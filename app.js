Right now I just got out of my first year at Montana State University studying computer science. Going to University wasn\'t what I was used to, taking a traditional path of education was the exact opposite of what my life growing up was like. So I decided to take this path to continue to grow as a software developer. My passion is creating projects and products that can make else\'s someone\'s life easier.';
